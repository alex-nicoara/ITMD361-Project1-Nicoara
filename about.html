        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Alexander Nicoara. I am currently a 5th year Computer Science major at Illinois Institute of 
          Technology specializing in Web Development. My hometown is Elk Grove Village, a northwest suburb of Chicago, 
          but I currently reside in Chicago during the school year. While on campus, I am involved with Cru and my 
          Fraternity (Phi Kappa Sigma). Both of these organizations have helped me grow professionally and personally, 
          leading me to be more organized, social, and personable. As a student, I am enrolled in classes pertaining 
          to web design, operating systems, probability/statistics, and graphics rendering protocol. I am eager to 
          finish my last semester of school before heading off into the real world.</p>

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>As a web developer, my mission is to produce graphically appealing and user-friendly websites/web-apps for 
          customers. I tend to put myself into the user's shoes and try to examine their thought process as they are 
          interacting with the web content. The design I choose must be simple for the user, easy to build upon, and 
          secure for both the client and the host. I believe these 3 components are the key to creating a great 
          website/web application. As a consumer myself, this is what I generally expect when browsing/interacting with 
          a website/web-app.</p>
