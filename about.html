        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Alexander Nicoara. I am currently a 5th year Computer Science major at Illinois Institute of 
          Technology specializing in Web Development. My hometown is Elk Grove Village, a northwest suburb of Chicago, 
          but I currently reside in Chicago during the school year. While on campus, I am involved with Cru and my Fraternity 
          (Phi Kappa Sigma). Both of these organizations have helped me grow professionally and personally, leading me to be 
          more organized, social, and personable. As a student, I am enrolled in classes pertaining to web design, 
          operating systems, probability & statistics, and graphics rendering protocol. I am eager to finish my last semester 
          of school before heading off into the real world.</p>
